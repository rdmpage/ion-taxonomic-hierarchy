# ion-taxonomic-hierarchy

A text version of the taxonomic classification of animals and protozoans used by [Index of Organism Names - ION](http://www.organismnames.com).

There is a text dump of the parent-child relationships, and a version of the same data as a graph (GML format) which can be viewed in yEd (the tree -> directed -> compact layout works well).

There is also a PNG image of the graph in the HTML folder.
